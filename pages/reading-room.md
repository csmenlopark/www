**Welcome!** Our Reading Room provides a quiet place to explore the Bible, the
writings of Mary Baker Eddy, and Christian Science publications such as The
Christian Science Monitor. Come explore spirituality, prayer, and healing,
peruse or purchase Christian Science publications, speak with a librarian, or
ask questions. Reading Rooms are open to people of all faiths, backgrounds, and
ways of life.
