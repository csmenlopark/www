There are two ways to join the Zoom meeting:

* You may join from your computer or smartphone:

    <br>
    (Note: If you don't already have the Zoom application installed, clicking the
    link will take you to instructions for installing it.)
  2. If prompted, enter this **meeting ID**: <span class="meeting-id"><span>174</span><span>873</span>568</span>

service.


## Wednesday <time datetime="19:30">7:30 pm</time>

Follow the instructions for Sunday above. (We now have a *recurring* Zoom

the service will begin.  Participants will be automatically muted during the
service. For testimonies, if you wish to share, please use the *Raise Hand*
feature and wait for the usher to call on you:

* To raise your hand in the Zoom application, find and click the **Participants** button to reveal the
  participant list, then find and click the **Raise Hand** button.

* To raise your hand via telephone, dial <span class="phone-keypresses">*9</span>.
