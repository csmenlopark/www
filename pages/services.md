## Sunday Service

Our Sunday service is at <time datetime="10:00">10:00 am</time>. This service
provides an atmosphere for prayer and for listening to a Bible Lesson-Sermon
that promotes healing. The Lesson-Sermon is composed of citations from The Bible
and Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures by Mary Baker Eddy. Every
service includes hymn singing by the congregation and an inspirational solo.

## Wednesday Meeting

Join us for our Wednesday evening testimony meeting at <time
datetime="19:30">7:30 pm</time>. This meeting includes the singing of hymns and
brief readings from The Bible and Science and Health on a timely subject. Those
in attendance are invited to share testimonies and remarks on how the teachings
of Christian Science are applied in their daily lives.

## Sunday School

Our Sunday School service is at <time datetime="10:00">10:00 am</time>, and is
open to students up to the age of 20. Sunday School instruction is based on the
Bible â€“ beginning with the Ten Commandments, the Lords Prayer, with its
Spiritual Interpretation by Mary Baker Eddy, and the Sermon on the Mount.  In
class, students learn of God's love for them, and how the spiritual and moral
teachings of The Bible and Science and Health can help them every day, in every
situation.

## Childcare

Child care for the very young is provided free of charge, under the care and
supervision of an experienced adult. Infants and children who are too young to
attend Sunday School are cared for lovingly.
